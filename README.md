## Project Structure

DishHub is organized into key directories and files:

- src: Contains the source code of the application.

  - components: This directory includes React components used to build the user interface. Each component serves a specific purpose, making the codebase modular and easy to maintain.

  - pages: The pages directory contains the main pages of the application. Each page represents a different view or section of the DishHub platform.

  - media: The media directory stores media assets such as images, allowing for an engaging visual experience for recipes. You can find photos of the delicious dishes shared by the        community here.

  - data: The data folder, also located in the src directory, holds data files essential for the platform. Here, you'll find recipes.json and user.json. recipes.json acts as a data 
    repository for all the recipes shared on DishHub, and user.json is used for user data management.
